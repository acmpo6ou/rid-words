### What's this?

This repository contains words from the [RID app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ua.rid). I reverse-engineered the app, and downloaded all 9580 words and their descriptions from their servers. Copyright belongs to the Р.І.Д. project.

### Why?

The app allows learning only 3 words per day. Furthermore, it doesn't check that you have remembered the words. Using the data I downloaded, you can build your own app, and learn the words the way you want.

### Download

You can get the data from the GitHub releases.
